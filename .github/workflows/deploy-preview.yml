            Vercel will automatically deploy a preview for this PR.
            The preview URL will be posted here once ready.

            ### Pre-deployment Checks
            - ✅ Contract tests passed
            - ✅ Mock tests passed
            - ✅ Build successful

            **Note**: Preview deployments use mock services by default.
